# Programming Paradigms - Lecture 5 (02/02/23)

Note: a common mistake among people just starting out with OOP is that they abuse inheritance and create deep, complex, and fragile hierarchies that easily break
* whenever inheritance between two classes is used we create *dependency*/*coupling* between them --> If a change is made higher in the hierarchy, the effects propagate larger the deeper in the hierarchy we go
* Rule of thumb: try to limit inheritance hierarchies to a maximum of 3 levels
